CRITICAL UPDATE with Real-World Evidence!

The testing log confirms EXACTLY what you predicted! ðŸŽ¯

**SMOKING GUN EVIDENCE:**
- Lines 19,27,28,30,31,32,33,34... show "Grid4: Wrapper background fixed" repeating every ~2 seconds
- Line 93: `[Violation] 'readystatechange' handler took 3411039ms` (57 minutes!) 
- This is the exact performance drain you warned about with the dangerous timer clearing!

**I've implemented your timer diagnostic wrapper** (emergency-timer-fix.js) with:
- Surgical timer identification instead of brute-force clearing
- Stack trace analysis to identify wrapper background timers
- Real-time monitoring and suspicious timer detection
- Emergency cleanup for Grid4-specific timers only

**Data Table Research Results:**
1. **Grid.js** - 2.5KB gzipped, high performance, modern
2. **Clusterize.js** - Performance-focused, renders only visible rows
3. **JSTable** - Dependency-free, framework agnostic
4. **Vanilla Data Table Component** - Bootstrap compatible
5. **Tablesort** - Simple, sorting-focused

**URGENT ARCHITECTURE QUESTIONS:**

1. **Emergency Priority Order** - Should I:
   a) Deploy timer fix immediately
   b) Refactor ConsistencyEngine to class-based CSS
   c) Implement build process
   d) Continue new features
   
2. **Data Table Choice** - Grid.js vs Clusterize.js for our virtual scrolling alternative?

3. **Build Process + CDN Injection** - How do I bundle locally then deploy to GitHub/Statically.io while maintaining injection architecture?

4. **Class-based CSS Architecture** - Specific implementation pattern for converting ConsistencyEngine's inline styles to utility classes?

5. **Safe Migration Path** - How to evolve from sequential loading to bundled approach without breaking existing functionality?

The log proves your analysis was spot-on. What's the optimal implementation strategy now?
