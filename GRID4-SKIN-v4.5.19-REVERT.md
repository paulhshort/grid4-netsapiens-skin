### Why
- User toolbar relocation (v4.5.13-v4.5.18) broke everything

- ✅ Sidebar navigation working
- ✅ Theme toggle in sidebar
- ✅ User toolbar in sidebar (not header)
- ✅ Contacts dock using stock styling
- ✅ Legend text fixes
- ✅ Table header alignment

### What We're NOT Doing
- ❌ Moving user toolbar to header

## Note
This is the last known working version before we tried to relocate the user toolbar, which broke everything.
