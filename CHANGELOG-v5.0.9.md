# Grid4 Portal Skin v5.0.9 - Changelog

## Summary
Complete rework of domain banner positioning to finally fix content overlap issue.

## Problem
The domain banner was still overlapping page content despite multiple attempts to fix it. The complex height calculations and fixed positioning were not working reliably.

## Solution
Simplified approach using CSS-based spacing:

### 1. Domain Banner Positioning
- Changed to `position: absolute` within the content area
- Positioned at `top: 45px` (header height) and `left: 245px` (sidebar width)
- No longer relies on JavaScript for height calculations

### 2. Content Spacing
- Added `.has-domain-banner` class to body when banner is present
- When class is present:
  - Wrapper gets extra `padding-top: 105px` (45px header + 60px banner)
  - Content gets `margin-top: 60px` as additional safeguard
- This ensures content is always pushed below the banner

### 3. Simplified JavaScript
- Removed complex height calculations
- Now only detects banner presence and adds/removes body class
- Much more reliable and performant

### 4. Better Banner Styling
- Domain message container uses flexbox for better layout
- Buttons and text properly aligned with gaps
- Responsive wrapping for smaller screens

## Technical Details

### CSS Changes:
```css
/* Banner absolutely positioned */
#domain-message {
  position: absolute !important;
  top: 45px;
  left: 245px;
  right: 0;
  z-index: 900;
}

/* Content spacing when banner present */
body.has-domain-banner #content {
  margin-top: 60px !important;
}
```

### JavaScript Changes:
```javascript
// Simple detection only
const hasBanner = $('#domain-message:visible').length > 0;
if (hasBanner) {
    $('body').addClass('has-domain-banner');
}
```

## Result
- ✅ Domain banner no longer overlaps content
- ✅ Simpler, more reliable solution
- ✅ Better performance (no constant height calculations)
- ✅ Works with dynamic content changes
