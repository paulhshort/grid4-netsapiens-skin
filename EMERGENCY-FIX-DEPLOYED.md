# üö® EMERGENCY FIX DEPLOYED

## What Was Fixed

The user reported that the Grid4 portal layout was completely broken with:
- Huge chart/graph area pushing content off-screen  
- Horizontal scrollbars
- Elements in wrong positions
- Content area completely unusable

## Root Cause

The `grid4-production-final.css` file was too aggressive with layout changes:
- `max-width` constraints on everything breaking responsive content
- `overflow-x: hidden` causing layout issues
- Complex Flexbox and grid overrides interfering with portal structure

## Emergency Fix Applied

**Replaced `grid4-production-final.css` with minimal sidebar-only CSS:**

‚úÖ **REMOVED:** All aggressive layout constraints  
‚úÖ **REMOVED:** `max-width` limits on content containers  
‚úÖ **REMOVED:** `overflow-x: hidden` on body/html  
‚úÖ **KEPT:** Grid4 sidebar positioning and styling  
‚úÖ **KEPT:** Responsive design for mobile  
‚úÖ **KEPT:** Navigation icons and hover effects  

## Testing Instructions

4. **Test Modals:**
