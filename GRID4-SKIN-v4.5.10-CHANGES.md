}
```

## 🛡️ Safety & Compatibility

- **Contacts Dock:** Zero interference - completely stock
- **Table Headers:** Uses standard CSS properties only
- **Button Bar:** Non-invasive spacer approach

## 🎨 Visual Results

### Contacts Dock
- **Now:** Exactly as NetSapiens designed it
- **Benefit:** No structural issues or broken functionality

### Table Headers  
- **Fix:** Headers should maintain width when scrolling
- **Method:** Min-width enforcement and overflow control

### Edit Pages
- **Fix:** Opaque button bar prevents see-through effect
- **Spacer:** Prevents content from being hidden behind buttons

## 🧪 Testing Focus

1. **Contacts Dock:** Should look and work exactly like default NetSapiens
2. **Tables:** Scroll and verify headers maintain alignment
3. **Edit Pages:** Check that button bar has solid background and content doesn't overlap

## 📊 Impact

- **Reduced CSS:** Removed ~300 lines of problematic contacts dock styling
- **Simplified:** Fewer selectors = less chance of conflicts
- **Performance:** Faster rendering without complex overrides

## 🚀 Recommendation

If contacts dock theming is required in the future, consider:
1. Working with NetSapiens support for proper customization methods
2. Using their API or configuration parameters instead of CSS
3. Creating a separate, minimal CSS file just for contacts dock that can be tested in isolation

The current approach prioritizes stability and functionality over theming for the contacts dock component.
