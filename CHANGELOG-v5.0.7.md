# Grid4 Portal Skin v5.0.7 - Changelog

## Summary
Fixed three critical UI issues while preserving all v5.0.6 improvements.

## Changes

### 1. Fixed Domain Banner Content Overlap
- **Problem**: Domain banner was overlapping page content
- **Solution**: Enhanced JavaScript to dynamically calculate banner height and add padding-top to content
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added `handleDomainBanner()` function that measures actual banner height
  - Applies padding-top to #content to push it below the banner
  - Uses MutationObserver to handle dynamic banner changes
  - Smooth transition when banner appears/disappears

### 2. Moved User Toolbar to Top Right
- **Problem**: App dropdown was appearing at far right edge of screen
- **Solution**: Repositioned entire #header-user container to right side of header
- **Implementation**:
  - Used `position: absolute` with `right: 20px` and vertical centering
  - Changed dropdown to `position: absolute` relative to its container
  - Set dropdown `right: 0` to align with container edge
  - Added `min-width: 200px` for consistent dropdown width

### 3. Increased Theme Toggle Size
- **Problem**: Theme toggle icon was too small (20px)
- **Solution**: Increased size by 20% to 24px
- **Changes**:
  - Width/Height: 20px → 24px
  - Font-size: 10px → 12px
  - Better visibility while maintaining proportions

## Technical Details

### CSS Changes:
- Domain banner uses `height: 0` with `overflow: visible` to prevent empty space
- Content padding is managed dynamically via JavaScript
- User toolbar positioned absolutely within fixed header
- Dropdown positioning is now relative to its parent container

### JavaScript Changes:
- Enhanced `handleDomainBanner()` function with height calculation
- Added smooth padding transitions for better UX
- Improved MutationObserver to watch for style and class changes

## Result
All three issues are resolved while maintaining:
- ✅ No empty space from domain banner
- ✅ All navigation icons visible
- ✅ Glass-morphism effects
- ✅ Light/dark theme support
- ✅ Proper CSS scoping
